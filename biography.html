      <h3>Chicago</h3>
      
      <p>I was born in the city of Chicago on <time datetime="07-17">July 17th, 1994</time>. I lived there for about 5 years before moving to Sammamish where I've lived in for the majority of my life. I love visiting Chicago regularly because my entire mother's side of the family uprooted from China and moved there. </p>

      <h3>Sammamish</h3>
      
      <p>I moved to Washington State when I was around 5 years old. I lived in Renton for 1 year before settling down in Sammamish to the present day. I really enjoy the weather in the Seattle Area where it's not too hot, not too cold. I for one welcome the balance of rain, sunshine, and occasional snowfall.</p>
